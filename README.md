# The-Fourth-Loop-Ryche-PCCS
A web-based implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life using Flask for backend processing and HTML5 Canvas for visualization. This project demonstrates real-time server-to-client communication through Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing the simulation to run on the backend while streaming updates directly to the browser.

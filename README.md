# 🧩 Test-Driven Development Practice

This repository is dedicated to exploring **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using **various Programming Languages**.  

> Made using Python

### 🔁 Development Approach  
The project follows the **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle:  
1. 🟥 **Red** — Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior.  
2. 🟩 **Green** — Implement just enough code to make the test pass.  
3. 🧹 **Refactor** — Improve the code while keeping all tests green.  

Commits may captures a step in this cycle, showing the Iterative and Disciplined Nature of Test-First Programming.

### 🎯 Objective  
Our goal is to develop a **deeper understanding of TDD principles** and strengthen **development discipline** through consistent, incremental, and test-driven design.
